                        During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus"
                         and "Wuhan coronavirus" with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".
                          In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations,
                           such as the Spanish flu,[24] Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus.
                            In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease
                             as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against 
                             using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and 
                             virus names in part to prevent social stigma. The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued 
                             by the WHO on 11 February 2020.Tedros Adhanom explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and
                              19 for 2019 (the year in which the outbreak was first identified).The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19
                               virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.

                    <article>
                        SARS stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome. In 2003, an outbreak of SARS affected people in several countries before ending in 2004. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is similar to the one that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak.

                       Since the 2019 coronavirus is related to the original coronavirus that caused SARS and can also cause 
                       severe acute respiratory syndrome, there is “SARS” in its name: SARS-CoV-2. Much is still unknown about 
                       these viruses, but SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and farther than the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 virus. This is likely 
                       because of how easily it is transmitted person to person, even from asymptomatic carriers of the virus.
